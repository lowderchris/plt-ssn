Grab up-to-date sunspot count numbers, and generate a few plots

## Background
Using the data from the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations -or- [SILSO](http://sidc.be/silso/home) database, the sunspot number is displayed in a series of two plots.

The datasets employed are:
- Monthly mean total sunspot number (1749 - present)
- Monthly mean North-South sunspot numbers (1992 - present)
- 12-month sunspot number forecast (Improved combined method prediction (Kalman))
