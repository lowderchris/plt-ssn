Grab up-to-date sunspot count numbers, and generate a few plots

### Background
Using the data from the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations -or- [SILSO](http://sidc.be/silso/home) database, the sunspot number is displayed in a series of two plots.

The datasets employed are:
- Monthly mean total sunspot number (1749 - present)
- Monthly mean North-South sunspot numbers (1992 - present)
- 12-month sunspot number forecast (Improved combined method prediction (Kalman))

The first plot will display the total sunspot number, overlaid with the hemispheric sunspot number for reference.
The second plot will display the hemispheric sunspot number, shading to indicate the dominant hemisphere.

### To-do list:
- Utilize sunspot number forecast data cleverly into plots
